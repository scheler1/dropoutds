## 1. Motivation and Goal
Student dropout is a significant challenge for higher education institutions, carrying financial and social costs for both students and universities.

**The goal of this project is to:**
1. **Analyze factors** influencing academic success or failure, including demographics, socio-economics, and academic performance.
2. **Visualize relationships** to gain actionable insights into why students drop out.
3. **Build predictive models** (Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest) to classify students into **Dropout**, **Enrolled**, or **Graduate** categories.
4. **Test early-warning reliability** by comparing predictions made at enrollment versus predictions made after the first semester.
